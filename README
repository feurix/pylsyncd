Pylsyncd is a python implementation similar to lsyncd that uses rsync to
synchronize local directories with several remote machines running rsyncd.
Pylsyncd monitors recursively a set of directories using pyinotify, a pure
Python module used for monitoring filesystems changes that relies on inotify.

The main advantage of pylsyncd against lsyncd is that it uses message queues in
order to synchronize in a parallel way several destination servers, saving up
time when it is required to have more than one destination. It has been tested
in heavy loaded environments.
